# Terrafrom for lamport on AWS

This is my development area for developing terraform to deploy a three node lamport cluster to AWS

Not sure what orchestration packacge I will use yet

This project is simply to setup and deploy the three nodes ande make them usable.


## Terraform

Note that terraform will setup everything in the current directory.
Keep only files for one setup in the directory 
Use "terraform plan" to see what it will set up

###Set up these env variables for logging
"export TF_LOG=TRACE"
"export TF_LOG_PATH=./terraform.log"
